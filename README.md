# Intra-Domestic Water Leaks Dataset
This dataset contains the time series of the cumulative volumes of water consumption of real residential users at 5-minute time step.

The dataset counts 40,428 examples, among which 30,744 are negative and the positive examples are divided into 3565 small leaks (<= 1 L/h), 5511 medium-size leaks (1 to 10 L/h), 608 large leaks (>= 10 L/h).

Each example is a record representing the flow rates for a specific day (24 hours) and a specific user.

The records were made anonymous and any identifying information were removed prior to analysis. 

This dataset was created in the context of the research project GST4Water ("Green Smart Technology for Water"), supported by Regione Emilia-Romagna within the context of the POR FESR 2014-2020 project, for the sustainable use of water resources in buildings and urban areas. The project involved two research laboratories of the Technopole of the University of Ferrara, two Interdepartmental Centres for Industrial Research of the Technopole of the University of Bologna, and the ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development) Laboratory for Environment (LEA).
